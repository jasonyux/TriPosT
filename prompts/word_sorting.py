Q: Sort the following words alphabetically:
List: oven costume counterpart
Answer: Let's think step by step.
(1) The first letter: "oven"="o" (15), "costume"="c" (3), "counterpart"="c" (3).
(2) We now have: (3) ["costume" ? "counterpart"] < (15) "oven".
(3) Now let's sort this subpart ["costume" ? "counterpart"] by looking at their second letters: "costume"="o" (15), "counterpart"="o" (15).
(3.1) We now have: (15) ["costume" ? "counterpart"].
(3.2) Sort ["costume" ? "counterpart"] again by looking at their third letters: "costume"="s" (19), "counterpart"="u" (21).
(3.3) We now have: (19) "costume" < (21) "counterpart".
(3.4) Hence, we have "costume" < "counterpart".
(4) Hence, we have ["costume" < "counterpart"] < "oven".
(Final response) So the answer is: costume counterpart oven. [END]
Q: Sort the following words alphabetically:
